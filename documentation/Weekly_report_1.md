# Week 1

Used hours during week 1:  4 hours

## Events of week 1
 * Development environment has been set up
 * Project has been created
 * Some research on pathfinding algorithms has been done
 * Basic definition for the project written
 
## Problems

Late start. Rushed to meet the deadline. I feel that the definition has to be improved and refined.
Did not manage to do any coding yet.

## Questions

Is it allowed to use an outside graphical library, such as JavaFX? This would be used to create a GUI, while all
the data structures pertaining to the actual pathfinding algorithms would be created by hand. Creating my own
graphics library sounds like too much work (could be wrong about this, don't really have much experience on those).

## Next week

Will start implementing the pathfinding algorithms, classes for the map, map nodes and such. I will use Java's built-in
data structures at this point, but will implement my own along the way.
