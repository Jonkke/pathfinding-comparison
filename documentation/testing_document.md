# Testing documentation

This document describes the various ways this project has been / will be tested.

## Unit tests
A suite of unit tests has been written for the core application and the supporting custom data structures. There are 22 unit tests in total.

## Components

### GUI
No individual testing has been done on the GUI, as this is not part of the core functionality. Has been manually tested while building it...

### Data structures
A small but sufficient suite of unit test has been written for the MapCellBinaryHeap and MapCellList data structures.

### Map classes
Couple of tests to ensure correct building of a map have been implemented.

### Algorithms
Dijkstra and AStar algorithm also have some basic unit tests written for them. One test for each to ensure correct operation on a loaded map.

## Performance testing
Performance testing document can be fonud in a separate file.

## Code & testing coverage
Still to be implemented...
