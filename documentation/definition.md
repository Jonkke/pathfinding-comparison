# Project definition

This project will focus on implementing and comparing at least two (possibly more) pathfinding algorithms in a graph, which can be used to find the shortest route between two nodes (or points on a map). The graph can be directed and / or weighted. In addition to the underlying algorithms and data structures, the intention is to crete a graphical user interface, in which the user can create randomly generated "maps", that will be used to test and illustrate the progression and resulting routes of the different pathfinding algorithms. The maps can also be drawn by hand, so that the user can create corner cases to see how the different algorithms perform in those. The main goal is to compare the speed, accuracy and overall effectiveness of the tested algorithms in various situations.

## Used algorithms and data structures

At least Dijkstras algorithm and the more advanced A* algorithm will be implemented and tested. All the necessary underlying data structures will be created from scratch as well, such as classes for maps, map nodes, routes on a map (may be weighted) and the like. Basic data structures, such as lists or stack/queue implementations will be created as well, as necessary.

## Input / Output

### Input
 * Maps can be loaded in to the app from text files

### Output
 * Graphical user interface / CLI interface will simulate the progression of an algorithm
 * Diagnostic data and benchmark results will be outputted

## Conclusion

The above forms the basis for the project. This page may still live, and illustrative diagrams may be added later on.

**Question for the course superviser**: Am I allowed to use outside graphical libraries (such as JavaFX) for creating a GUI? I'd really like to create a GUI, rather than use a pure CLI. But I feel that if I need to create my own graphics library for this, things could get a bit too complicated (time-wise at least...)

Feedback is also welcome...
