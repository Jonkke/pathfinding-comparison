# Week 3

Used hours during week 3:  9 hours

## Events of week 3
 * Did more research on algorithms
 * Wrote first version of A* and some basic tests for it
 * Improved some things here and there
 
## Problems

This week was unproductive because of illness, being distracted by other ongoing courses and stuff like that. I must really focus on this project next week, as I did not manage to complete most of the stuff I intended on week 3. I'm pretty clear on what to focus on now, however.

## Questions

Nothing at the moment, I'm pretty clear on what to do.

## Next week

TODO:
* Base data structures:
  * PriorityQueue
  * ArrayList
* Importing of maps
* More and better tests
* GUI
* Refactoring & commenting of code to make it more sensible
