# Week 2

Used hours during week 2:  12 hours

## Events of week 2
 * Project definition has been refined and target time complexities have been added
 * Base classes for the map, map cells and cell edges have been written
 * First working version of the Dijkstra algorithm was written
 * Done more research on the subject, particularly on the A* algorithm and the jump-point search optimization for it
 
## Problems

I'm not used to working with Gradle, have had to put some time into looking into it's configuration. A bit short on time,
I could have used more hours this week. Still don't fully understand how the heuristic in A* is supposed to work, need to
research it some more and do some testing. I feel the tests I have written so far for the Dijkstra are bit too basic at
this point, need to see if I can find a way to test it more thorougly.

## Questions

Don't really have any questions right now, but if either my project structure or code looks bad / badly commented / too messy,
feel free to comment. And if I should have more tests. Should the tests be commented also?

## Next week

Will implement the A* algorithm next week. Will also start creating my my own implementations of the base data strucutres, such
as ArrayList and PriorityQueue. Will also look into how to best integrate a GUI, and start work on that if I have time. Importing
map files, such as those on MovingAI, shall be implemented as well.
