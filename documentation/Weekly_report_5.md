# Week 5

Used hours during week 5: 6 hours

## Events of week 5
* Some research
* Wrote own list class to replace arraylist for MapCells
* Wrote more tests
* Peer reviewed another project that was assigned to me
 
## Problems

Progress pretty nonexistent this week, because of bad scheduling etc. GUI still needs work and documentation is lacking. Testing documentation still does not exist.

## Next week

TODO:
* Improve GUI
* Focus on documentation and begin performance testing
* Refactoring & commenting as necessary
