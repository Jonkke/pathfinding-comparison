# Week 6

Used hours during week 6: 12 hours

## Events of week 6
* Documentation
* GUI Imporvements
* Researched Gradle more thorougly
* Looked into various testing solutions and performance comparison
 
## Problems
Progress has been much slower as I've had much less time for the project than anticipated.
I'm pretty confident that I'll still be able to finish it for the final deadline though.
If there is something that is considered critical for the passing of this course that has been
overlooked, let me know.

## Next week

TODO:
* Testing, reports, documentation
* Finish GUI
* Implement the actual comparison and tie it to GUI
